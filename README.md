# Technical Writing Playbook (TWiP)

Welcome to the TWiP site! TWiP will provide basic guidance on how to write a technical blog, article, white paper, software documentation, and other content forms that techies often need to create in a hurry. TWiP will focus on the key elements of planning and structuring your content, the 20% of the work that provides 80% of the results.

I will be developing plays for TWiP in the coming months. As of early 2023, there's nothing ready for anyone to actually read. I'll announce here, on LinkedIn, and on my blog when I've got some content ready for community feedback.

If you have suggestions for content types you'd like to see in the TWiP or any other questions or comments for me, please contact me at karen@scarfonecybersecurity.com
